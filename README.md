These are some solutions to Project Euler problems.
  http://projecteuler.net

Most of the code builds/runs on Mac OSX with some additional packages
and libraries:

* Intel Thread Building Blocks
* OpenMP
* MPI
* The Scientific Python Stack

Some of it will build and run on Scientific Linux Fermi as well.
